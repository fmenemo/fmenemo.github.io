This big project has been a challenge of uniting great technologies together with the goal of creating a professional fully functional webpage that can replace and improve substantially the current page my clients are offering to the public. The goal of this page is to offer my clients a way to show their work and how people can contact with them as well as way for University students to sign-up and make an appointment to have their graduation photographies taken.

Although the pages that are offered to a normal user are quite simple, the administrator panel is quite complex and has helped me progress as a webdeveloper and a developer in general striving to come up with the easiest and most efficient solution possible.

During this time I've become quite familiar with Spring Framework, although my use my differ from others since I'm aware that I'm not using Spring to its fullest potential, due to the fact that I'm using Tomcat as a helper to manage the environment in which the application is deployed.

The page itself consists of a combination of multiple technologies and systems such as: Virtual payment systems, email confirmation for user creation and automatic deletion after a certain time has passed, email integration for mass mailing and for contacting the shop and image uploads. All of these really shine with the biggest backend and database structure I've built until this date with 7 complete entities and 4 additional ones to handle the relationships between some of the entities.

The last big challenge was choosing a platform to host the project itself, and in the case of Java web applications there isn't a lot to choose from to be honest. So the solution resulted in buying a full linux-based machine to host the project and also to be able to tinker with the subsystems of the machine given my background in Systems Administration.

Finally, I'd like to acknowledge that although Java and Spring offer some great workarounds for most people problems when approaching a JavaEE developement project, there are a number of limitations that still exist with this platform and therefore I'm eager to learn more about the possibilities that other languages and platforms such as Node.JS and Angular.JS can offer, and afterwards integrate them into future projects.
