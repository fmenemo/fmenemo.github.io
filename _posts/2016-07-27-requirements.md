Being a student in the specialty of Software Engineering, defining the requirements of the system you're about to build is given a great importance as it should, but even with all the knowledge that our teachers try to teach us we don't realize given importance until we create our first full project with real clients.

Just to be clear, this isn't a rant of a bad experience with a project but a fair warning for the most common mistake you can make when you begin building something, the requirements phase. Also, the majority of the examples that I'll be talking about can be applied to most areas of work, but there'll be some that are specific to web development.

So, you've been asigned your first project and you have to establish contact with your clients in order to fullfill their expectations, where do you begin? The first thing you should be talking about is what do they want, and this isn't as simple as it might seem. You want to know how do they vision their UI to look, and even if you have to do some draft drawings, do them, they'll come handy afterwards. There might be the chance that they don't have a clear vision or that they don't care much about the UI and they leave the details to you, that's fine, just be sure to leave that clear with them so that there are no further misunderstandings in the future. By the way, make sure to include every detail you can in those drafts, such as the amount of text inputs that they want to have in a form in a web page, or the content of a navbar in an application.

After you have all your drafts and all your requirements clear, make sure to write them down formally and elaborate a document that gathers all of them. If there are certain requirements that directly relate to a drawing that you've previously made, make sure to include that drawing as well, even if it's a draft. After all of your requirements have been written down and you have clearly specified the interactions that will occur between the actors of given system, it's time to leave a blank space at the end of your document so that your clients can sign that document.

Now you've probably beginning to understand the importance of given document. It's the only safeguard you have in case your clients tell you at the end that the product you're delivering doesn't satisfy the things that they told you, so now you'll have a signed document that specifies to the very last detail what you agreed on. Also make sure to print two copies of that document and make sure that both copies are signed by you and your clients, one copy is for you and another one is for them.

Finally remember that problems are very likely to happen, and that the first projects will be much more difficult to manage than the last ones, but that's okay, that's what experience is for: learning about your mistakes and making sure that you don't make them again in the future.

This covers the basics of avoiding some problems whenever your project is in the last stage, as problems are more likely to happen in given stage rather than in the early phases. Also be sure to have an open mind, and treat your clients respectfully, no one likes someone that is complaining all the time and after all they're the ones that are going to pay you for your work (another thing that should be stated clearly in the requirements document that you're going to create :wink: ).
