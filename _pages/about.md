Hello, my name is Francisco Menéndez Moya and I'm a student at the University of Zaragoza in Aragón, Spain. Currently I'm in my last year of studies, as I try to specialize in Software Engineering since it is my passion and what I feel the most comfortable doing. English is another subject that I try to improve day by day, so bear with me if I have any gramatical mistakes since Spanish is my native tongue :smile:.

Throughout these years of studies I've learned multiple programming languages as well as multiple computer engineering fields, but as I previously said before, the thing I feel the most comfortable doing is Software Engineering including web pages, architectural design, and programming in general.

My current specialties are Spring Framework along with MySQL and Tomcat for web programming, and for general purpose I feel that Java is what I really shine at. Although don't get me wrong, I'm open to new challenges and new ways to perform better!
